# ROADMAP

TBD the long-term storage, but in the immediate term, want to explore:

- Configuring Cursor to use MCPs.
- Configuring open-webui/LibreChat to use MCPs.
- Configuring AI-clis (i.e. codex-cli, claude-code, gemini-cli...) to use
  MCPs.
- How to document the MCPs I'm using...
- Is there a way to centralize MCP hosting (for non-filesystem specific contexts)?
